For these research I choose Bootstrap.

Bootstrap is its grid system, which makes it effortless to create responsive layouts for various screen sizes and devices. Bootstrap also offers many UI components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and models, making it a versatile choice for designing simple and complex web applications.

In my opinion, Bootstrap is a fantastic choice for web development for several reasons. Firstly, its grid system provides a flexible and responsive layout structure that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, making it easier to create mobile-friendly websites. Secondly, Bootstrap's extensive library of UI components saves development time, as developers can readily use these pre-designed elements rather than building them from scratch. This accelerates the development process and ensures a consistent and visually appealing design across the entire website. Additionally, Bootstrap is well-documented and has an active community, so finding solutions to common issues and getting help with development problems is relatively easy. Bootstrap is a reliable and robust CSS framework that streamlines web development and produces professional-looking results.
